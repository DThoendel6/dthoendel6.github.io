		During creation of this project, I made a simple, 1-table DB. It contains a UserID, unique to each user,
		a Username, which I also required to be unique due to the size of this program, a Password, which I didn't 
		encrypt, a UserHighScore, which is the highest score that user has achived, and a UserNumberOfGamesPlayed,
		which increments everytime the user clicks Play. <br>
		This program was made in a tighter timeline which didn't allow me to go as in-depth with the DB as I 
		would've liked. The end result would've included a leaderboard sorted by highest score, and if there was a tie,
		would be sorted depending on fewest plays. <br><br>
