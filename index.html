		<h2>Hello!</h2>
		<p>
		I'm a software developer looking to gain knowledge and 
		skills regarding the industry, so that I may someday build and 
		deploy my own software.
		</p>
		<p>
		I have posted a couple of breakdowns for projects that I worked on for class. 
		The first tab is a Yahtzee game I made using C# in visual studios. 
		The Click Adventure tab is a click adventure game I made in PHP. I used 
		Netbeans for the IDE, and XAMPP to simulate a server running along with 
		database control from phpMyAdmin.
		</p>
		<p>
		In these breakdowns, I'll post screenshots of the program in action, along
		with screenshots of some code or database logic. The full code is available 
		to browse through on my Github page.
